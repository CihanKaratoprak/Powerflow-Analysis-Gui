# Power Flow Analysis GUI (AC/DC) + Short Circuit

This repository contains the release information of a power systems analysis desktop application developed as an R&D-focused engineering project.

## Features
- AC power flow
- DC load flow (optional method)
- Short-circuit analysis
- Scenario save/load
- Automatic line parameter calculation (R–X) based on conductor selection and line length

## Download & Install
Go to **Releases** and download the latest `PowerFlowAnalysis_Setup_*.exe`.

## License
This project is distributed under a proprietary license. The installer is provided for evaluation purposes and includes an EULA.

## Development Notes

The current version is maintained as a single-file prototype in order to
prioritize numerical validation and rapid feature development.

As part of the ongoing R&D roadmap, the codebase is planned to be modularized
into separate core, utils, and model layers to support long-term scalability,
maintainability, and further academic extensions.
